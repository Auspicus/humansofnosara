<p>My name is Gustavo Miranda Cambronero but you can call me Tao. I first arrived in SÃ¡mara looking for a new way of life because I found the city too complicated and monotonous, it is always the same scene with different characters, I wanted something more than that. I started studying arts and it was in this moment that I realised that cooking was my thing. I noticed when I put my food on the table the entire energy of the room changed. There is a good feeling when people enjoy the food. The two things I love most about Nosara are the people and the energy. If I could live anywhere in the world, I would choose somewhere with the same vibe as Nosara.</p> <p>I think that the experience that we obtain from making mistakes is what makes us grow as people and teaches us a valuable lesson for the future. That is why even if I could, I wouldn&#39;t change any of my past mistakes.</p> <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/humansofnosara/image/upload/fl_progressive/v1502838534/Gustavo%20Cambronero/Tao-Full_rim2sw.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/humansofnosara/image/upload/fl_progressive/v1502838534/Gustavo%20Cambronero/Tao-Full_rim2sw.jpg 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/humansofnosara/image/upload/fl_progressive,c_scale,w_720/v1502838534/Gustavo%20Cambronero/Tao-Full_rim2sw.jpg 720w" alt="Tao holding a coffee and hanging out."> <p>I opened El Mystiko Kolibri in January of 2017 and I love this business, this is my art. I want to offer people a wide variety of food to cater to the range of diets which people have here. But my business comes second when compared to my main goal in life. I want to be a good father for my son. I want him to feel that he can learn something "taunis" from me.</p> <p class="article-detail__small-text"> You can find El Mystiko Kolibri in <a href="https://www.nosara.com/listings/gabis-play/">Gabi&lsquo;s</a>, Downtown Guiones. </p>
