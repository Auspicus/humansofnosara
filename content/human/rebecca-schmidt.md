I came to Nosara by chance. I won a ticket to Costa Rica from a raffle back in Canada. A few of my friends and I came early to scope out the place, driving up and down the coast, and we actually came across Nosara by accident. But as soon as I saw it I knew this was a place I could live. I felt a profound sense of homeliness which I never felt back in Canada. Nosara was just full of beauty. I was captured by the pristine landscapes and beaches. I felt as though it my duty to come back.

After returning to Nosara, I started my 200 hours of yoga teacher training and began peeling back these layers within my mind. I had no idea that when I got here I would be taken on a spiritual healing journey that would unravel some deep truths about my past. I discovered a repressed childhood trauma that I had buried in my subconscious. This intense realisation triggered post traumatic stress disorder and I started to feel lost.

To help myself get better, I went to some acupuncture sessions and # and stumbled upon a lady who worked with tarot cards. I had always been interested in tarot cards and I wanted to know more about how they were used. I asked the woman if she could purchase a deck for me and I started to teach myself how to read them. Things continued to get darker for me and I was looking for something to put my faith into, the cards gave me something to believe in. I would get these positive messages which provided the strength I needed to carry on. Eventually, the cards just became fun. I loved reading and interpreting their energy.

Before I came here I worked in many different industries. The most recent job I had before I left was for the City of Toronto in Parks and Recreations. I got to mow lawns and run park maintenance which helped me to connect with nature whilst in the city. Now I work for vive el sueno, a non profit here in Costa Rica. We empower and educate local ticos and ticas to become small business owners. We provide them with 40 hours of business training, 60 hours of English lessons, social media training, as well as their own logos from Zac and a session with our professional photographer, Veronica.

I love working with our participants. I’ve always had a soft spot for the underdogs, those who never got the opportunity to succeed. I feel like through our platform those who maybe never got the education or experience to learn these things are finally given a chance. It really warms my heart to see how dedicated and grateful these people are. They make vive el sueño.

If there’s a few things I could fix in Nosara it would be the healthcare and school systems. We really need our own medical laboratory for blood tests and other lab work. Some people here have to travel all the way to Nicoya or even San Jose to drop off samples. The school system also needs some funding. With teachers being in short supply, sometimes the children will have 1 or even 2 days off in a week. It all comes down to money in the end though. We just need more funding for these public services.
