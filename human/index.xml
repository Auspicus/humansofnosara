      <description>We met in Alajuela in a fabric store where we both worked, since then we have always worked together and made a living together. Before we got married Alexander was very sick and when we went to the doctor, I was advised against marrying him, but we got married anyway. I knew this illness would not defeat him.
I am a native of Nosara, but I left when I was 12 years old.</description>

      <description>I have lived in Nosara all my life. I love to be surrounded by all the people from town who I have known since I was a child whilst also being in touch with the new people and being able to learn from them. A group of people who I think should receive some attention are the children who live in the poorer areas of town. I would love to make a positive improvement in their lives and I believe the idea of a recreational center which opens doors to better opportunities is a good start.</description>

      <description>Back home I was a journalist. I started in Kentucky but after a couple of years landed a job in DC working for a congressman. After that, I did public relations and writing for trade associations for many years. My girlfriend asked me twenty years ago to come to Nosara for a yoga trip and I bought some land on my first visit. This made it possible for me to setup a home and for my first three years here I was barbecuing with the community and writing articles for The Voice of Nosara (now known as The Voice of Guanacaste).</description>

      <description>I was born on the north coast of Peru. I grew up in a place close to the sea and since I was a little girl I’ve had a passion for the surf like my family, although I didn’t learn how to surf until I came to Costa Rica when I was 16. After that I travelled to many different parts of the country and 6 years ago I found Nosara, the place where I came to get my yoga instructor certification.</description>

      <description>My name is Gustavo Miranda Cambronero but you can call me Tao. I first arrived in Sámara looking for a new way of life because I found the city too complicated and monotonous, it is always the same scene with different characters, I wanted something more than that. I started studying arts and it was in this moment that I realised that cooking was my thing. I noticed when I put my food on the table the entire energy of the room changed.</description>
