      <description>Back home I was a journalist. I started in Kentucky but after a couple of years landed a job in DC working for a congressman. After that, I did public relations and writing for trade associations for many years. My girlfriend asked me twenty years ago to come to Nosara for a yoga trip and I bought some land on my first visit. This made it possible for me to setup a home and for my first three years here I was barbecuing with the community and writing articles for The Voice of Nosara (now known as The Voice of Guanacaste).</description>

      <description>My name is Gustavo Miranda Cambronero but you can call me Tao. I first arrived in SÃ¡mara looking for a new way of life because I found the city too complicated and monotonous, it is always the same scene with different characters, I wanted something more than that. I started studying arts and it was in this moment that I realised that cooking was my thing. I noticed when I put my food on the table the entire energy of the room changed.</description>
